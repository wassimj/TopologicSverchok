![TopologicSververchok-logo](assets/TopologicSverchok-Logo-500x250.png)

**TopologicSverchok** is a [Sverchok](http://nortikin.github.io/sverchok/) implementation of [Topologic](https://topologic.app). 

[**Topologic**](https://topologic.app/) is a software modeling library enabling hierarchical and topological representations of architectural spaces, buildings and artefacts through non-manifold topology. 

[**Sverchok**](http://nortikin.github.io/sverchok/) is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes.

TopologicSverchok requires the following modules to be installed:

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

### Optional python modules:

The installation of these optional python modules will activate additional TopologicSverchok nodes. These python modules can be installed in the site-packages folder inside the topologicsverchok folder. Familiarity with python module installation is needed.
