# TopologicSverchok

![TopologicSververchok-logo](assets/TopologicSverchok-Logo-500x250.png)

**TopologicSverchok** is a [Sverchok](http://nortikin.github.io/sverchok/) implementation of [Topologic](https://topologic.app) both running within [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

[**Topologic**](https://topologic.app/) is a software modeling library enabling hierarchical and topological representations of architectural spaces, buildings and artefacts through non-manifold topology. 

[**Sverchok**](http://nortikin.github.io/sverchok/) is a powerful Blender Addon parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes. 

[**Blender**]() is a FOSS 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. It has an API for Python scripting for customization and writing specialized tools such as TopologicSverchok.

## Prerequisites

TopologicSverchok requires the following software to be installed:

* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) >= v3.2
* [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/) >= 1.1.0
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) >= 1.22.4

### Optional Dependencies

The installation of these optional python modules will activate additional TopologicSverchok nodes. These python modules can be installed in the `site-packages` subdirectory. 

```bash
    TopologicSverchok
    └── site-packages
```

Familiarity with python module installation is needed.
